# Alert.AI
Alert AI is a bot Mechanism based on Fetch.AI Technology
# Description
Alert.AI uses a decentralised system connecting emergency and general vehicles. When emergency vehicles start their journey, they provide their destination. Our software then tracks both types of vehicles and calculates the distance between them. Based on this distance, it notifies nearby general vehicles, giving them time to move aside for the emergency vehicles. This helps ensure smoother traffic flow and faster emergency response along with Real time Communication.
